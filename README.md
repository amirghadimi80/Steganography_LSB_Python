**Steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) in Python**

Steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) in Python
This project focuses on implementing steganography, the practice of concealing secret messages within ordinary files like images, using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique in Python. The LSB method is a popular approach for hiding data within digital images by modifying the least significant bits of the pixel values. The key aspects of this project include:

Understanding Steganography: An introduction to the concept of steganography, its applications, and the importance of secure communication.
    Least Significant Bit (LSB) Technique: Exploring the LSB method, which involves modifying the least significant bits of pixel values in an image to encode the secret message. This technique ensures that the changes made to the image are imperceptible to the human eye.
    Encoding Process: Implementing functions to encode a secret message within an image by converting the message into a binary string and embedding it into the least significant bits of the image's pixel values.
    Decoding Process: Developing functions to extract the hidden message from a steganographic image by retrieving the least significant bits of the pixel values and converting the binary string back into the original message.
    Image Processing: Utilizing Python libraries like Pillow or OpenCV for image manipulation, including reading, modifying, and saving images.
    User Interface (Optional): Creating a user-friendly interface, such as a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt, to allow users to encode and decode messages easily.
    Error Handling: Implementing error handling mechanisms to ensure the robustness of the application and provide appropriate feedback to users in case of invalid inputs or file formats.

Throughout the project, emphasis is placed on understanding the underlying principles of steganography, the LSB technique, and the implementation details in Python. Real-world examples and test cases are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the steganography tool. By the end of this project, users will have a working steganography application that can hide and retrieve secret messages within digital images, providing a practical understanding of secure communication techniques and data hiding methods.
